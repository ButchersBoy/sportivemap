# sportivemap

This is just a demo app with me playing around with a few web techs:

* node.js
* React
* Redux
* Google Maps API
* Semantic UI

There's no database; data is scraped and dumped into a JSON file whenever I can be bothered.  Most of it was written a while back so missing out on some new React features such as stateless components.
